This part can be done analytically.
The position in x and y direction is initially like this (p = (x,y))

p = p0 , p0+p0-1,  p0 + p0-1 + p0-2 ...
Realising that this:
p(t=tmax) = sum_t=0^Tmax-1 (p0-t) = p0 (p0+1)/2
the expression for arbitrary t we can get from subtracting 
the sum for p(t=t) = (p0-t)(p0-t+1)/2

p(t) =p0 (p0+1)/2 - (p0-t)(p0-t+1)/2 (1)

for x this is true for t <= x0, where x(t) = x(t=x0) for t > x0
 
for y this is ture for all t. 

We realise that the trajectory is symmetrical, as soon as the dead point / 
maximum of the trajectory is overcome we go down by 1, 2, 3 ... . Therefore
we will be at point zero after twice the time it took to get to the high point:

dy/dt = y0 - t + 1/2 --> t_max = y0 + 1/2 --> t_zero = 2y0 + 1 

The next step after the zero crossing will take it to:
y0 - t_zero = -y0 - 1. (2)

(somehow it does not work wity y - t-zero -1.. Probably because of some
index mixup higher up.)

Since equation (1) is monotonically increasing in p0, y_max is maximised
by maximal y0. If we therefore make it in one step from the zero crossing
to the most negative value in the target area, we will have maximised y_max.

-y0 - 1 = ymin = -68 --> y0 = 67 --> t_min_y = t_zero + 1 = 134 + 1 + 1 = 136

y(t=136) = -68
y(t=67/68 (t_zero)) = 67*67 = 2278

To check if x is feasible: 
x(tmax) = x0(x0+1)/2  
xmax >= x(tmax) >= xmin

--> x0^2 + x0 - c = 0 needs to have an integer solution (for c) where
                       c is inbetween xmin and xmax. This is the case 
                       here (23).
